## Conversation

I will be breaking down these studies by answering the following questions:

What was their model for prediction?
Was there statistical significance?
What was their ultiamte success rate in their methods?
Extra information noted?



## Research articles

### What's the problem?

Part of the World Health Organization's guidance on limiting further spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. As a result, schools in most affected areas are taking precautionary measures by closing their facilities. With school-aged children at home for an indeterminate amount of time, keeping them engaged, entertained, and on top of their education is important.

I will be breaking down these studies by answering the following questions:

"

I will also attempt to put the research articles in order of publication date, rather than potential importance
