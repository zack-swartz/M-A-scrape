## Short description

### What's the problem?

Part of the World Health Organization's guidance on limiting further spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. As a result, schools in most affected areas are taking precautionary measures by closing their facilities. With school-aged children at home for an indeterminate amount of time, keeping them engaged, entertained, and on top of their education is important.

### How can technology help?

Schools and teachers can continue to engage with their students through virtual classrooms, and even create interactive spaces for classes. As parents face a new situation where they may need to homeschool their children, finding appropriate online resources is important as well.

### The idea

It's imperative that learning and creating can continue when educational institutions have to shift the way they teach in times of crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing a set of open source tools, backed by IBM Cloud and Watson Services, will enable educators to more easily make content available for their students.

There are studies suggest accurate predicting models for future M&amp;A of stocks, potentially shedding light on a strategy with alpha

I will be breaking down these studies by answering the following questions:

"
What was their model for prediction?
Was there statistical significance?
What was their ultiamte success rate in their methods?
Extra information noted?
"

I will also attempt to put the research articles in order of publication date, rather than potential importance



































































What I get out of all of this infromation:
