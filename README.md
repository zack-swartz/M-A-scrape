## Conversation

I will be breaking down these studies by answering the following questions:

What was their model for prediction?

Was there statistical significance?

What was their ultiamte success rate in their methods?

Extra information noted?

I will also attempt to put the research articles in order of publication date, rather than potential importance



## Research articles

### What's the problem?

Part of the World Health Organization's guidance on limiting further spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. As a result, schools in most affected areas are taking precautionary measures by closing their facilities. With school-aged children at home for an indeterminate amount of time, keeping them engaged, entertained, and on top of their education is important.

### How can technology help?

Schools and teachers can continue to engage with their students through virtual classrooms, and even create interactive spaces for classes. As parents face a new situation where they may need to homeschool their children, finding appropriate online resources is important as well.


## My take

I believe there are a few main take-aways from these articles. Having a high success rate in predicting mergers prior to them occuring within a one year timeframe is possible with a relatively high probability, as proven in aricle ____. The idea of stocks that are usually targets for M&A that was brought up multiple times by these articles (____) has been shown to have significance within the studies time and time again. Knowing this, I believe that there needs to be a fundamental analysis aproach taken to this potential edge. Potentially some sort of analysis.
